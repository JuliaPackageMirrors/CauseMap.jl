Convergent cross mapping (CCM) provides a model-free approach to detecting dependencies
and establishing causality in complex non-linear systems, even in the presence of feedback loops and
unmeasured confounding [1]_. CCM derives this power from
explicitly capturing time-dependent dynamics through a technique known as
state-space reconstruction (SSR). In practice, this analysis
typically requires 25 or more time points, measured with sufficient density
to capture system dynamics.

How CauseMap works
------------------
To get a feel for the algorithm and the intuition behind it, we highly recommend
the following two videos from `George Sugihara <http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/gsugihara/biocv>`_'s group at UCSD:


Time series as projections of full system dynamics
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following video will explain this concept using the Lorenz attractor (or butterfly manifold) as an example system.

In summary, the first animation explains how time series can be viewed as projections of
higher-dimensional system dynamics. In this light, one can see that time series
of individual variables each contain information about their full causal system.
The second animation explains a corollary to this observation: shadows of full
causal systems can be constructed using individual time series. For further details,
please feel free to consult the original reference (below), or our description in
the `CauseMap manuscript <https://peerj.com/articles/824/>`_.

Model Parameters
----------------
Library size
++++++++++++
Libraries are the collection of data points used for cross mapping.
Convergent cross mapping gets its name because, if a relationship is truly causal,
predictive skill should converge with library size (read: amount of data used).
Library-relevant parameters are:

- ``libsizemin``: The minimum library size.
- ``libsizemax``: The maximum library size. For long time series, for example, you may not want to use the largest possible library.
- ``nboots``: This allows you to switch from the traditional "slide window" approach to bootstrap library selection. As an example, ``nboots=20`` will randomly select 20 libraries at each library size.

Note: the bootstrapping approach generally performs better than
sliding windows because it isn't as sensitive to secular trends.

**In future releases, this will be the default.**

Predicted data
+++++++++++++++
- ``predstart``: The first point to be predicted from the target time series.
- ``npred``: The number of points to be predicted by each library.
- ``tau_p``: The assumed time lag for the causal effect.

Manifold reconstruction
++++++++++++++++++++++++
- ``E_vals``: This sets the range of manifold dimensions to test. The higher dimensional reconstructions are necessary for causal systems with a larger number of components.
- ``tau_s``: The time lag to use for manifold reconstruction. A value of one is customary, but data may be thinned if autocorrelation is strong.
