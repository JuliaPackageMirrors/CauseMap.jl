Paramecium and Didinium
-----------------------
This is a well-studied, unicellular predator-prey system with interesting non-linear dynamics.

To see these guys in action, check out a couple minutes of this video:

Predator-prey dynamics and manifold reconstruction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Below we provide plots of the time series of Paramecium and Didinium,
as well as their manifold reconstructions alongside the full system manifold.
Specifically:

- *The first two panels are the time series for the predator-prey system.*
- *The third and forth panels show the manifold reconstructions from each time series.*
- *The fifth panel gives a view of the full manifold.*


Note that corresponding points can be simultaneously highlighted across plots using the ``select`` tool.
