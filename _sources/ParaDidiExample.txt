Predator-prey dynamics and manifold reconstruction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Below we provide plots of the time series of Paramecium and Didinium, as well as their manifold reconstructions alongside the full system manifold.

Note that corresponding points can be simultaneously highlighted across plots using the ``select`` tool.
